Steps:-

Distortion correction:

Camera matrix and distortion coeffs were calculated for the chess board images to undistort the image. ouput is saved in output_images/camera_cal .


Thresholding:

I applied thresholds on colors and gradients(rgb,hls) to get a binary threshold black and white image


Perspective transform:

Chose vertices to make a trapezium and transformed to bird's eye view.


Sliding window search:

Calculated position with the help of histogram and drew lane lines and took a margin to 50 pixels to detect the lane lines as a generic broad lane to be followed.

ROC:

Calc. radius of curvature and centre offset


Inverse transform and Coloring Green:

Color the road between lanes and inverse transform it form bird eye view back to driver's view and overlap the colored image with the original one


Pipeline

Apply the functions sequentially to the video
